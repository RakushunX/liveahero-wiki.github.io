He transforms into a hero that can show off his best performance as a carpenter.  Even in this form, he's still undoubtedly a drunkard, but he can use his split-toe-shoes-shaped parallel weapon to walk on vertically on walls, and then, using various tools from toolbox-shaped parallel weapon, build high quality walls and shelters at a speed that no normal person could do.

He is a diligent man who works as a shipwright in charge of repairs and onboard construction in a shipboard city in the ocean planet of Muirauqa IV. Originating from a different planet, he eventually arrived to Muirauqa IV after wandering.

He is a lewd optimist with a sloppy personality, a heavy drinker, and an irresponsible carpenter that doesn't let go off his bottle of booze even at work. Despite this, he possesses firm arms and dexterous fingers. Contrary to expectations, he can easily assemble blueprints in his head and has the ability to accomplish precise and perfect architecture.
